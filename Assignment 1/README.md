I chose to produce an interactive canvas where you can draw with the use of the mouse. The size of the ellipses are dependent on the speed of the mouse, and each ellipse that is created is on the position of the cursor. With an element of randomness each of the ellipses use different colours, this also includes the stroke.
I created a reset function by pressing Spacebar to clear the canvas and in doing so it randomises the background colour. In addition I created text to tell the user on screen how to clear.
